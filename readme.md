# My public music jam songlist

This repository contains my public list of songs for music jam sessions.
The songs are recorded in the [ChordPro](https://www.chordpro.org/chordpro/chordpro-introduction/) format.

## Usage

- You can either use the source *.cho documents to generate pdf files by using the [ChordPro](https://www.chordpro.org/chordpro/chordpro-installation/) tool. Linux (or [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)) users can just run `make`.

- Or you can just import the *.cho files into an app like the [SongbookPro](https://songbook-pro.com/).
